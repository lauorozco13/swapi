# Summary

The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate your ability to create a web app that can consume an API and display information in a meaningful way. This is your chance to show us what you're made of ðŸ˜€

# Instructions

Build a UI worthy of Mordor. Just kiddingâ€¦

Using [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/), build a UI with routes for each resource (people, films, starships, vehicles, species, and planets.

1. Your app should have some kind of navigation for easily accessing the routes in your app. OK
2. Each resource should have a list view that lists the documents from the API. The list should be searchable by name. OK
3. Build a detail view that each item in your list links to to display the item's properties OK
4. Create a local storage to track how many times each viewed item has been viewed (most popular items) OK
5. Build a Popular Items view that lists the most popular items based on the local storage tally of item views. OK
6. Given that there are 6 resources, we suggest creating/ using reusable components. OK

The instructions are open-ended to provide you creative space to make this project your own!
